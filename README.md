# EV_Vehicle_Demand_Prediction
In the first week, we began by importing the necessary Python libraries to support data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning tasks. We loaded the Electric Vehicle Population dataset into a pandas DataFrame and conducted an initial exploration to understand its structure and contents. Following this, we addressed missing values in key columns such as County and State, and ensured the Date column was properly converted to datetime format. We then examined the Percent Electric Vehicles column for outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method, identifying a significant number of extreme values. To mitigate their impact without discarding data, we applied outlier capping, which preserved all records while reducing skew in the target variable.
